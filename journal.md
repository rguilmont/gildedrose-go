# Gilded-roses

- First thing i did, was getting all the specifications from GildedRosesRequirements.txt and right tests.

- After that i refactor the code to make it more readable

- Then implemented conjured items

- Then, added the augmentedItem, which allows to isolate the UpdateQuality function, and make ( i hope ? ) code more maintainable + isolate potentials issues
