# Gilded-roses

- First thing i did, was getting all the specifications from GildedRosesRequirements.txt and right tests.

- After that i refactor the code to make it more readable

- Then implemented conjured items

- Then, added the augmentedItem, which allows to isolate the UpdateQuality function, and make ( i hope ? ) code more maintainable + isolate potentials issues

## What i've learned

- Making tests before refactoring was really helpful, though it's not always possible
- Specs are somewhat blurry, i discovered undocumented behaviour. I wanted to preserve the original behaviour.
- I did this kata with [Koroeskorh](https://github.com/Koroeskohr/gilded-rose-kata/tree/master/scala), who did it in Scala, but it was very interesting to discuss implementations and ideas. It was not pair-programming, but we had technical discussion about some points that were always relevant
